A list of projects I'm working on now. Sometime there might be a list for "Next" projects and "Later" projects. (I particularly like the now-next-later framework for most everything. If you aren't familiar with it here is a [decent post on it](https://www.prodpad.com/blog/invented-now-next-later-roadmap/).)

### Now Projects

- [A Gmail extension that I made so I can quickly filter emails to find all the emails from the selected sender.](https://github.com/dontoisme/Gmail-Quick-Filter)
- [A one time use script to pull the bookmarks from Chrome and write it to a CSV. Also to grab all my favorited links from HackerNews. ](https://github.com/dontoisme/PythonWeb)
- JobJournal: A simple app to help me document my work history and use the writings to make "sounds like me" resume's and cover letters using GenAI.
