# Articles That Stick With Me

A curated collection of articles that have left a lasting impact and continue to influence my thinking. These pieces regularly resurface in my mind and conversations.

### How I Choose Articles

I add articles here when they meet one or more of these criteria:
- I find myself referencing them frequently in conversations
- They've fundamentally changed how I think about a topic
- They offer unique insights that have proven valuable over time
- I keep coming back to reread them

*This is a living document. New articles are added as I discover them and confirm their lasting impact.*
