Working in Product Management, I find myself thinking about Chapter 24 from [The Restaurant at the End of the Universe](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8695.The_Restaurant_at_the_End_of_the_Universe) by Douglas Adams quite a bit. 

Even more so now as I'm seeking my next opportunity as a Director of Product or Head of Product. 

You can read [Chapter 24 and my take on why I named this blog the way I did here.]({% post_url 2024-10-23-Chapter-24 %}).
