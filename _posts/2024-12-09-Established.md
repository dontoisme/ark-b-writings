# Established

I'm feeling like I'm finally starting to get a handle on using Github Pages and Jekyll as a blog. My original goal was to get up and running but still utilize the same tools as if I were building a custom site. 

That means getting familiar with using git and github again as well as learning the basics of Jekyll. My commit count for today (Dec 9th) is going to be a little high because it took some figuring out but I got it and I'm having fun.

There are too many things I want to start writing about and I'm hopeful to start to track them down in either new posts or new [lists](/lists). 

Some of the things I have bouncing around in my head:
- Books
- My 2024 favorited and bookmarked articles and analysis of them
- Being on the job hunt in the age of AI.
- Awesome things I've done in my career or sort of a "best of" or expanded resume.

The first step is to get into the habit of writing a bit more and working on my projects, which I'm pretty excited about thanks to the help of Cursor and v0.dev.
